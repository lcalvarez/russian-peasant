# russian-peasant
This repository contains a simple ipython notebook
that implements the russian peasant algorithm
for multiplying two numbers demonstrating simple
recursion and iteration.

Want: to test if this works for any two numbers, including n as an element of the Reals (Irrationals included) and/or the Complex.
